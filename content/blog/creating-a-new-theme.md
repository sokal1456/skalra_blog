# “The secret of getting ahead is getting started.” – Mark Twain

Welcome to my blog. I will primarily devote this blog to exploring new (at least new to me!) techniques in data science with Python and R.  I have wanted to do this for a little while now and am excited to share this journey with you.  

A few caveats:

1. This blog represents my personal views and learning journey. 

2. Please use the material in this blog as a reference as I don't claim to be an expert on any of these topics.
