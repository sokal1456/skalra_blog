title: About Me
---

My name is Soumya Kalra and Iâ€™m a Quantitative Risk Specialist in market risk and trading. This blog is focused on my personal learning journey as I devote time to learning the ever changing landscape of data science. I have also been an active open source community organizer by founding the R-Ladies New York chapter (https://www.rladiesnyc.org).

Personally, I have just relocated to the bay area from the east coast and love exploring the beautiful landscapes here so all recommendations are welcome.
