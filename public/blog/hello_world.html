<h1>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started.” – Mark Twain</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog. I will primarily devote this blog to exploring new (at least new to me!) techniques in data science with Python and R. I have wanted to do this for a little while now and am excited to share this journey with you.</p>
<p>A few caveats:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This blog represents my personal views and learning journey.</p></li>
<li><p>Please use the material in this blog as a reference point as I don’t claim to be an expert on any of these topics.</p></li>
</ol>
